		 * Suppose Player A has a rating of 1613, and plays in a five-round tournament. He or she loses to a player
		 * rated 1609, draws with a player rated 1477, defeats a player rated 1388, defeats a player rated 1586, and
		 * loses to a player rated 1720. The player's actual score is (0 + 0.5 + 1 + 1 + 0) = 2.5. The expected
		 * score, calculated according to the formula above, was (0.51 + 0.69 + 0.79 + 0.54 + 0.35) = 2.88.
		 * Therefore, the player's new rating is (1613 + 32(2.5 âˆ’ 2.88)) = 1601, assuming that a K-factor of 32 is
		 * used.
		 *
		 * 1 - win
		 * 0 - loss
		 * .5 - a draw is considered half a win and half a loss
